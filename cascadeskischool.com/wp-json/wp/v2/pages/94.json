We call it the &#8220;lesson status line.&#8221;\u00a0It is updated by 6:30 a.m. and the message will state &#8220;yes, we&#8217;re running&#8221; or &#8220;no, we&#8217;re not running.&#8221; Lessons may be cancelled due to extreme weather, road conditions, power outages, etc.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>Q: Do you take President&#8217;s Weekend off?<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"> A: Yes, since many of our students and families plan a ski vacation during this holiday.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"><strong>Q: What happens when lessons are postponed or canceled?<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-family: helvetica, arial, sans-serif;\"> A: Since all instruction is reserved for the entire season, there are no refunds or make-up lessons if a student misses a class. \u00a0There may be unforeseen circumstances or conditions which will force the ski school to postpone or cancel a session or sessions. \u00a0In the event of a postponement, make-up lessons will be scheduled and the ski\/snowboard season will automatically be extended until ALL lessons are completed. \u00a0So, plan for an extended ski\/snowboard season if we should get a late start or have any interruptions in our schedule. \u00a0If we are forced to cancel and the program is not completed, we will refund prorated tuition fees based on the number of weeks ski school operated. \u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) Q: What clothing and equipment do you recommend for skiing and\/or snowboarding?
